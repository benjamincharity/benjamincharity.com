# Show the Finder status bar in OS X 10.8 and later.

The Finder status bar offered a quick reference to how many files/folders existed in the current directory along 
with your hard-drive's available space.

It turns out that rather than removing it, Apple simply defaulted it to hidden (at least since 10.8).

With Finder focused, go to `View > Show Status Bar`. Or if you plan on toggling the status bar on/off,
simply hit <kbd>command+/</kbd> to quickly show or hide the status bar.
