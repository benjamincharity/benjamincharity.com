# Angular URL Encoding

Recently a project I was working on required the ability to URL-encode various strings in order to create `mailTo:`
links on the fly. Because more than one of our modules needed this ability, I decided to create a simple
component to share the code between modules.

This is dead simple thanks to JavaScript's `encodeURI` and `decodeURI`. Take a look:

Feel free to [grab it on Github](https://github.com/benjamincharity/angular-url-encode) or [offer any improvements](https://github.com/benjamincharity/angular-url-encode/issues).
