# Ever wondered where the title 'UX' originated?

It seems we can track it back to the early 1990s at Apple. Coined by none other than the influential author of *The Design of Everyday Things* and *Emotional Design*, [Donald Norman][dNorman].

According to his account:

> "I invented the term because I thought Human Interface and usability were too narrow: I wanted to cover all aspects of the person's experience with a system, including industrial design, graphics, the interface, the physical interaction, and the manual." <small>(Buley pg13)</small>
