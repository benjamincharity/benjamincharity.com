# Log In vs Login vs Sign In

This is a subjective question, but as a team you may need to come to an agreement on what is 'right' for your product. Here are some snippets of information gathered for a team discussion.

## Sign In & Sign Out

- Familiarity: [Jakob Nielson][nielson] (the 'father' of UX) did a study back in the early 2000s and decided to use 
  _sign in/out_ rather than _log in/out_. While that was quite some time ago, in 2010 Lee Munroe did an [informal 
  follow up][monroe] and showed that _sign in/out_ was still more commonly used.
- The only valid argument against this format that I have found is that it can be confusing when used next to 'Sign Up'.

## Sign Up vs Register or Create an Account etc.

- _Sign Up_ can convey a more legal or contractual feel for some users.
- When using _Sign In_, _Sign Up_ is too close and becomes harder for users to parse, causing more incorrect clicks.

## Login vs Log In

- _Login_ is the noun/adjective form referring to the form, page or actual credentials.
- _Log In_ is the verb form referring to the action. i.e. _"Use your login credentials to log in via the login page."_

Personally, I'm a fan of using _Sign In_ and _Create an Account_.
